# write your answare in answare.

## Task 1:

What is the result of the expression (true && false)?
## Answare
  false

## Task 2:
Determine the value of (false || true)?
## Answare
  true

## Task 3:
Explain the difference between the && and || operators in JavaScript.
## Answare
### Logical AND (&&)
The logical AND operator (&&) evaluates to true if both operands are true. If either operand is false, the entire expression evaluates to false. Additionally, the && operator uses short-circuit evaluation, which means that it stops evaluating as soon as it encounters a false operand.
### Logical OR (||)
The logical OR operator (||) evaluates to true if at least one of the operands is true. If both operands are false, the entire expression evaluates to false. The || operator also uses short-circuit evaluation, meaning it stops evaluating as soon as it encounters a true operand.

## Task 4:
Predict the outcome of (true && true && false).
## Answare
Here's a breakdown:

true && true evaluates to true.
true && false evaluates to false.
So the complete expression (true && true && false) evaluates to false.

## Task 5:
What does (false || false || true) evaluate to?
## Answare
  true

## Task 6:
Evaluate the expression !(true && false).
## Answare
  true

## Task 7:
Determine the value of (true || (false && true)).
## Answare
Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

(false && true) evaluates to false.
(true || false) evaluates to true.
So the final result of the expression (true || (false && true)) is true.

## Task 8:
Given the expression (true && (false || true)), what will be the final result?
## Answare
Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

(false || true) evaluates to true.
(true && true) evaluates to true.
So the final result of the expression (true && (false || true)) is true.
